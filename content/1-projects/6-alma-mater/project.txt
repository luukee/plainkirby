Spring 2015 I was asked by my friend (link: http://www.kimberlyperl.com/ text: Kimmie target: _blank) to take on a web project at Clever Creative. That web project turned out to be the Alma Mater website.

I was fresh out of college and excited to get into designing some websites. 

The site was built on WordPress with (link: https://themeforest.net/item/hershel-flexible-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/12850028 text: Hershel target: _blank) theme created by (link: https://gt3themes.com/ text: GT3 Themes target: _blank). 

As well as custom HTML and CSS.

This site was awarded the 2017 American Web Design Award.
