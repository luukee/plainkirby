Lileo startup site I developed while at Clever Creative Agency.

WordPress WooCommerce rent and purchase eCommerce site.

PHP, HTML, CSS, (link: https://foundation.zurb.com/ text: Zurb Foundation), and (link: https://www.tychesoftwares.com/ text: Tyche Software) were the technologies I used to put the project together.

I also gained some great insights from the great people at (link: https://premium.wpmudev.org/ text: WPMUDEV).
