I wrote an email to a developer friend of mine named Josh (great guy & a developer for the past decade!!) and I thought I should put it on my blog. So here you have it:

I've been using (link: https://teamtreehouse.com/ text: Treehouse target:_blank) for all of my code learning. Treehouse has an excellent UI and it puts you on a track to an endpoint(mine is Front End Developer), but it's $25/month. 

I started out using (link: http://lynda.com/ text: Lynda.com target:_blank), the cool thing about Lynda is you automatically have a free subscription if you have a (link: https://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/contact-us/adult-library-card-pre-registration text: Los Angeles Public Library Card target:_blank), I'm sure it will be the same with you in San Diego.

I've also used (link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/ text: Code Camp target:_blank), its free and a great way to learn (I wish I knew about it before Treehouse so I didn't get started on a track and spend $$ ;)

Also, on iOS there's (link: https://www.sololearn.com/ text: Solo Learn target:_blank) and (link: http://lrnapp.com/ text: Lrn target:_blank). I've completed several full courses on Solo Learn.

Good stuff! Let me know if you have any more questions!
