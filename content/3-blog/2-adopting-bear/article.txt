(image: bear-taking-a-nap-while-i-work.jpg)I've been a little off the radar recently as my girlfriend Kait and I last week adopted a little (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Jindo text: Jindo) puppy named Bear from South Korea.

Bear was not a dog that someone had dropped off or given up on, he was in fact rescued by the wonderful people at the (link: https://www.petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/95447 text: DoVE Project) right before being taken to be slain (excuse my french) for a South Korean detestable restaurant. Just under a year old he was kept out behind the restaurant with his collar strapped so tight it cut into his little neck.

His 20+ hour journey from Korea brought him to us at the LAX International terminal. He was in such shock he wouldn't come out of his crate. He was fairly sedated for the flight so he had no energy for 2 days after we got him to the house. Bear was reluctant to let us pet him and unbelievably timid.

Now Bear is out of his shell! Being around other dogs and girls is his favorite. He always dreams when sleeping with little yelps and moving paws. If you give him a bone to chew on he ever so gingerly takes it in his mouth, careful not to act out. When he eats he usually grabs 1 piece of food from his bowl brings it to the living room to chew it up. Then he goes back for another piece. The cutest thing ever.

I couldn't pass up the opportunity to write a bit about this little friend of ours.
